# a_eye

Cataract classification tool built with Flutter.

## Development Guidelines

If you're planning to contribute, please follow this simple workflow to keep the project clean and consistent:

1. **Create a new branch** for any feature, fix, or change you’re working on.

   * Example:

     ```
     git checkout -b feature/new-ui
     ```
2. **Work on your branch** and commit regularly with clear messages.
3. Once you’re done, **push your branch** to the repository:

   ```
   git push origin feature/new-ui
   ```
4. **Make a Pull Request (PR)** to the `api` branch.
5. Wait for review and approval before merging.

Keep the `api` branch stable — no direct commits there.

### Quick Setup

1. Install Flutter and ensure your environment is configured.
2. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/a_eye.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project:

   ```
   cd a_eye
   ```
4. Get dependencies:

   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```
5. Run the app:

   ```
   flutter run
   ```
